            <p>The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 are clinical tools
            intended for use by health care professionals who are already familiar with the proper use
            and indications of the questions and formulas for each instrument. These questionnaires may
            be used only with the understanding and acceptance that there may be errors and inaccuracies
            present, and the creators of this app are not liable for any errors, inaccuracies or for the
            use or misuse of these questionnaires. Both the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire-R and the Hopkins
            Symptom Checklist-25 are instruments to be administered by qualified health care professionals,
            or para-professionals under supervision, trained in their administration and interpretation.
            These tests are not diagnostic tests. Always consult a qualified health care professional
            before using any medical assessment instrument. These instruments were not designed to be used
            as a self-report, no checklist can replace the role of a health care professional. </p>
