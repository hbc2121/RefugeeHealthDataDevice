<p>
       We're just about done with Phase 1 of our project. We have a front-end that 
       displays all of the questions and has toggles/dropdowns/textboxes for the 
       clinicians to fill in when they are with a patient. We are working on sending
       that information to be a PDF that can be downloaded and we're almost done 
       implementing that. Our next step after this week will be to implement the
       authentication and storing/retreiving the data.

        We met with Panetta and a few members of Dr.Mollicas team and came out of the 
        meeting extremely agggrevated. We are hoping to have a meeting with you (Sam)
        to discuss what happened and what we can do from here.

       We've been working consistenly on the first phase of our project. We have a front
       end that allows users to login or create a new account. We also display questions
       and have toggles to answer them. We ahave the beginning of a backend, which
       serves data to the front end and is hosted on a heroku server set up.

        We didn't do any real work over the break, but we are energized, excited and
        prepared for the semester ahead. In addition to our design document, we have a
        basic front-end set up, complete with tabular views. We have set up our app so
        that it deploys to both iOS and Android devices from a single code base. Last
        week, we regrouped and divided up tasks for the rest of the semester. For example,
        we decided to switch from a Django back-end to a Node JS backend.
</p>
<p>
        Next week, we are meeting with both our sponsor (Dean Panetta) and our client, Dr.
        Mollica. We are also planning to complete setting up our Node JS server, database,
        and finishing our front-end wireframes.
